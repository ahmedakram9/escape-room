                    It’s late in the afternoon and you’re just about to leave the office
                    when an alert suddenly flashes on your screen.
                </p>

                <div class="urgent-box">
                    <p class="urgent-title">URGENT MESSAGE</p>
                    <p>
                        A logic bomb has been planted inside the company’s deployment system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It will trigger in <strong>15 minutes</strong> unless a 5-digit
                        <strong class="cancel-code">CANCEL_CODE</strong> is entered.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    You are the only one still in the office.
                    The rest of the team is away at a conference.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everything is now on your shoulders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You blink at the screen, unsure for a moment what to do
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another line appears:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    “The code is hidden in five parts of the development room.
                    Solve each station to retrieve one digit.”
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    You know if the deployment system goes down, the upcoming release for
                    <strong>Northstar Analytics Ltd.</strong> will be completely blocked.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project is already on a tight deadline.
                    Failure now would mean missed delivery, contractual penalties,
                    and a very unhappy client.
                </p>
                <p>The development room door is slightly open.</p>

                <p>
                    You step into the development room.
                    The door shuts behind you with a soft click.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During solving each station you will be able to get hints,
                    but each hint will cost you 30 seconds of time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Five stations are set up around the room, each with a different problem to solve.
                    A small display near the door lights up with clear instructions:

                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    “Complete all five stations.<br>
                    Collect all five digits.<br>
                    Enter the final code at the emergency panel.”
                </blockquote>

                <p>Your task is clear:</p>

                <p class="mission">
                    Solve all five puzzles and stop the system before the timer runs out.
                    <strong>Good Luck!!</strong>
                </p>
