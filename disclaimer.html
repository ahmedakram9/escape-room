    <h1>Disclaimer & Acknowledgements</h1>

    <p>
        This web-based escape room was developed as part of a final year academic project.
        The design, logic and implementation were created by the project author.

        <h2 style="color:#00D4A6; font-size:18px;">Use of AI-Generated Images</h2>
        <p>
            Some visual assets (images from station 1 to station 5) used in this project were generated using artificial intelligence image generation tool (ChatGPT).
            These images were created to support the thematic and narrative elements of the escape room.
        </p>

        <p>
            The AI-generated images were used solely for educational and demonstration purposes within this academic project.
            All images were reviewed and selected by the project author to align with the intended design and user experience.
